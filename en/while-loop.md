# While Loop

A while loop in One programming repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.

## Syntax

```
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

## Example

```
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  cout << i << "\n";
  i++;
}
```

| :point_up: | In the example above, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5. |
